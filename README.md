# buscraper
node.js module for collecting BU class related information

This is module is published on npm so installation is very simple.
Just open up a terminal that has npm CLI installed and execute the following command in the project directory.
```
npm install buscraper
```
or if you have a package.json and you want to add the dependency right to the json file, execute the following.
```
npm install buscraper --save
```

I will be adding some documentation and new features soon.
